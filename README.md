## Description
Actions:
- left/right/down/up

States:
16 numbers (for 4X4 grid)

---
## Progress

- [x] Board Complete
- [x] Game Logic Complete (for verification)
- [ ] Q-Learning Agent Implementation

---
## Notes

At this point, I will implement the Agent using a Deep Neural Network
with a simple multilayer construct.
If that doesn't suffice, I will implement the Agent with a Convolutional Network.
Given that the state space is anticipated to be enormous, it is impractical to use a Q-table.
